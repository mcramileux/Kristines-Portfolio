# Kristine's Bootcamp Portfolio

## Description

As a coding bootcamp student, my motivation for building my portfolio with HTML and CSS is to showcase my skills and create a representation of my work that could be easily accessible to potential clients and employers. I wanted to create a visually appealing and functional platform that would highlight my strengths and demonstrate my technical abilities.

The main problem that my portfolio aims to solve is the challenge of standing out in a competitive market. With so many talented developers out there, it can be difficult to make a name for oneself and get noticed by potential clients. By building a polished and professional portfolio, I hope to differentiate myself and demonstrate my value to clients looking for a skilled and dedicated developer.

Throughout the process of building my portfolio, I learned a great deal about HTML and CSS, including how to structure pages using HTML tags, efficiently organise and style content using CSS such as Media Queries and Responsive Design, Flexbox and CSS Variables and Selectors. These tools helped me incorporate responsive design principles to ensure an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices. I also gained a better understanding of the importance of user experience and effective visual design in creating a successful, user-friendly website. Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience that has prepared me for future web development opportunities.
