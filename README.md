# Kristine's Bootcamp Portfolio

## Description

As a coding bootcamp student, my motivation for building my portfolio with HTML and CSS is to showcase my skills and create a representation of my work that could be easily accessible to potential clients and employers. I wanted to create a visually appealing and functional platform that would highlight my strengths and demonstrate my technical abilities.

The main problem that my portfolio aims to solve is the challenge of standing out in a competitive market. With so many talented developers out there, it can be difficult to make a name for oneself and get noticed by potential clients. By building a polished and professional portfolio, I hope to differentiate myself and demonstrate my value to clients looking for a skilled and dedicated developer.

Throughout the process of building my portfolio, I learned a great deal about HTML and CSS, including how to structure pages using HTML tags, efficiently organise and style content using CSS, and incorporate responsive design principles to ensure an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices. I also gained a better understanding of the importance of user experience and effective visual design in creating a successful, user-friendly website. Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience that has prepared me for future web development opportunities.

## Installation ----STARTING FROM HERE, NEED TO EDIT THIS PART

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
